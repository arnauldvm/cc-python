> ℹ You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests.
> These steps help to ensure high code quality
> and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something.
> Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup,
> such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
