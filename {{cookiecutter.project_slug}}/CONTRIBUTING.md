Bug reports
-----------

If you think you've found a bug in the software,
first make sure you're testing against the _latest_ version of the software --
your issue may have been fixed already.
If it's not, please check out the issues list on _{GitLab or JIRA}_ and search for similar issues
that have already been opened.
If there are no issues then please submit a _{GitLab or JIRA}_ issue.

If you can provide a small test case it would greatly help the reproduction of a bug,
as well as a a screenshot, and any other information you can provide.
